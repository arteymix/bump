Bump is a library designed to make asynchronous programming easy by providing high-level data structures for concurrency management, including multi-threading and main loop callbacks, in GObject/GIO based projects, especially those written in Vala.

# Features #

  * Simple asynchronous and synchronous APIs throughout (all blocking methods have asynchronous versions)
  * Asynchronous tasks can be executed in idle callbacks or threads
  * Implements patterns common in high-level languages, but exposes a C API

# API #

Bump is currently in an early stage of development. If you would like to see where it is you can take a look at the current [API reference](ReferenceManuals.md). If you would like to see where it is headed, see the [API Planning](APIPlanning.md) page. Feedback and suggestions are especially welcome at this early stage.
